# Git Pull All Script

This script allows you to perform the git pull --all command in each directory. It automates the process of pulling updates from remote repositories in multiple subdirectories.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the git_pull_all.py script.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
```  
python git_pull_all.py [directory_path]  
```  
Replace [directory_path] with the optional path to the directory containing subdirectories where you want to execute git pull --all. If no directory path is provided, the script will operate in the current directory.

The script will iterate through each subdirectory, execute git pull --all command, and display the progress.
